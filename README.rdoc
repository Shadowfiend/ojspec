= ojspec

ojspec is a sort of port of RSpec to Objective-J. For the time being, its
purpose is to port a subset of RSpec's unit specification syntax to Objective-J
in a way that makes sense in Objective-J. The idea here is to express tests in a
relatively natural syntax as expectations on what should happen. These same
tests are grouped together in an overall specification. For example, a Room
class may need to have name and owner properties that are assignable (this being
a fairly trivial example).

== Sample

A sample test for that might be:

 [Test for: Room
       with: function() {
         [Room should: "allow the setting of the name"
               by: function() {
                 var room = [[Room alloc] init];
                 [room setName: "hi"]

                 [[room name] shouldEqual: "hi"]
               }]
         [Room should: "allow the setting of the owner"
               by: function() {
                 var room = [[Room alloc] init];
                 [room setOwner: "john"];

                 [[room owner] shouldEqual: "john"]
               }]
       }]

Once we have that test set up and saved in a RoomSpec.j file, we can run it with
ojspec:

 $ ojspec RoomSpec.j

The ojspec executable assumes that you have the objj executable installed. It
then runs each spec and gives you a running result. The current format for these
results is:

Room
 - should allow the setting of the name: success
 - should allow the setting of the owner: failure

== Future

More work to come, including color-coding for success/failure, clearer failure
indications, pre- and post-running code blocks, and stack traces when an
exception stops the system. Also planned is integration with the Ruby ZenTest
suite's autotest tool, to continuously run specifications.
